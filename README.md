# RealLifeVh3gah × Linktree Integration Docs

Official developer documentation for the **RealLifeVh3gah** project.  
Created and maintained by [@vh3gah](https://github.com/vh3gah).

---

## Overview
This repository contains documentation for upcoming integrations between **RealLifeVh3gah** and **Linktree**.  
The goal is to create **Link Apps** and **custom integrations** that help creators share authentic stories and connect with audiences in new ways.

---

## Planned Features
- **Interactive Storytelling Apps** – let creators publish short stories or experiences directly in their Linktree.  
- **Audience Engagement Widgets** – polls, Q&A, and feedback forms built into Linktree.  
- **Future Public API** – endpoints that allow creators to connect RealLifeVh3gah tools to their Linktree profile.
